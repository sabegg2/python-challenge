Module 3 Challenge

There are two Python assignments in this Challenge. There is a folder for each, named PyBank and PyPoll. Each folder contains: (1) A file main.py, which is the main script to run for each analysis; (2) A Resources folder that contains the CSV files used. (3) An analysis folder that contains the text file that has the results from the analysis.

I wrote the code entirely on my own without collaboration or any online AI source (although Google was occasionally helpful for syntax). Several of the methods and techniques we learned in class (e.g. using a with statement to load a csv file, the commands to load and read a csv file).

My outputs match those in the Bootcamp Spot description of the Challenge.
