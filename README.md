Module 3 Challenge

There are two Python assignments in this Challenge. There is a folder for each, named PyBank and PyPoll. Each folder contains: (1) A file main.py, which is the main script to run for each analysis; (2) A Resources folder that contains the CSV files used. (3) An analysis folder that contains the text file that has the results from the analysis.

I wrote the code entirely on my own without collaboration or any online AI source (although Google was occasionally helpful for syntax).
